# Bank Management System (C++)

A console-based bank management system written in C++.
This project focuses on practicing core programming concepts such as file handling, data structures, and menu-driven applications.

## Features
- Add new clients
- Update client information
- Delete clients
- Search for a client by account number
- Deposit and withdraw funds
- Display total balances
- Persistent data storage using text files

## Technologies Used
- C++
- File I/O (fstream)
- STL (vector, string)
- Console-based UI

## Data Storage
Client data is stored locally in a text file (`Clients.txt`) using a custom delimiter-based format.

## Purpose
This project was built as part of my learning journey in C++.
It aims to strengthen understanding of:
- Structs and functions
- Separation of logic
- File-based data persistence
- Program flow using menus

## Notes
- This is not intended to be a production-ready system.
- The focus is on learning and applying fundamental C++ concepts.

## Future Improvements
- Refactor using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Improve input validation
- Enhance error handling
- Replace file storage with a database
